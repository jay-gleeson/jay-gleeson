# Hi, I'm Jay! 🫶

I’m a second-year Computer Science student at Golden West College 🎓 with a strong passion for Software Development. I’m eager to launch my career and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry by building solutions that solve real-world problems.
Over the past two years, I’ve grown both technically and personally through a mix of academic coursework, personal projects, and involvement in campus activities. I’ve developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, and have also worked with tools like Git, Visual Studio Code, and basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I’m a highly motivated and curious individual 🚀 who enjoys learning new technologies and applying them creatively. I believe my strengths in logic and critical thinking drive me to develop meaningful and impactful software ✨. I’m excited to continue building my skill set and am currently seeking opportunities, whether internships, collaborative projects, or mentorships, that allow me to learn from others and contribute to innovative work.
