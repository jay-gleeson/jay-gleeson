# Hi, I'm Jay! 🫶

I am a first year student at Golden West College majoring in Computer Science. I am very excited to begin my career in Software Development! I am a highly motivated person and very excited to become a valuable asset in my field! In my time at Golden West and through both social events and personal projects I have developed my skills in various languages. I immensely enjoy tackling challenges and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. I believe my strengths in logic and critical thinking drive me to develop meaningful and impactful projects.
